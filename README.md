# Spam or Ham Classification using Natural Language Processing

Welcome to the Spam or Ham Classification project! The primary objective of this project is to perform classification on text messages, distinguishing between spam (unwanted or irrelevant messages) and ham (legitimate messages). The project aims to build a predictive model for spam detection using natural language processing techniques.

## Project Overview

### Aim of Development:
The project focuses on analyzing text messages, categorizing them as either spam or ham. The goal is to develop a robust model that accurately identifies and filters out spam messages, providing users with a cleaner and more secure communication experience.

### Data Descriptions:
The dataset comprises a collection of text messages, with some labeled as spam and others as ham. The objective is to train a machine learning model that can generalize well to distinguish between these two categories.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- CountVectorizer
- WordCloud
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

# **Model Building**
1. Decision Tree
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine
5. ADABoost
6. Gradient Boosting

### Naive Bayes
The spam or ham classification model is built using the Naive Bayes algorithm, leveraging its effectiveness in natural language processing tasks. The model is trained on the dataset to learn patterns and characteristics of spam and ham messages.

## Results

After extensive model building and evaluation, the application of SMOTE in conjunction with the Naive Bayes algorithm has proven successful. The model achieves an accuracy exceeding 89%, indicating its proficiency in accurately classifying messages as spam or ham.

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with different techniques, and contribute to the ongoing development of this project. Your engagement could contribute to the enhancement of spam detection methodologies and their application in real-world scenarios.
